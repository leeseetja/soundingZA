**A Radiosonde and Skew-T Primer**

As in any other natural sciences, weather and climate science research - and the subsequent modelling and prediction - highly depends on observations. The ability to observe many points in space is fundamental to building a clear picture of the atmosphere. The use of radiosondes is one primary way these observations are made. A radiosonde is an instrument mounted on a ballon filled with either hydrogen or helium gas which enables the vertical measurement of critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, humidity and winds. Many other essential parameters are then derived from these primary measurements which help scientists and weather forecasters at the South African Weather Service initialise numerical weather prediction models and make local severe weather forecasts. Apart from Meteorologists using radiosondes observations for weather forecasting, academics and scientists at various institution across the country use them for weather, air pollution, model evaluation and climate change research. 

To analyse and visualise near-surface to upper-air atmospheric conditions at a given time, a Skew-T Log-P Diagram (typically just called a Skew-T diagram) is normally used to plot observations from the radiosondes.
